<h2>Important Dates</h2>
<ul>
 <li><strong>August 14, 2017</strong>: Deadline for paper submission (5:59 pm EDT)
 <li><strong>August 25, 2017</strong>:	Notification of decision
 <li><strong>October 24, 2017</strong>: Workshop (full-day)
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="lead">The aim of this workshop is to promote greater interaction between the diversity of researchers and practitioners who examine how to mix human and computer efforts to convert visual data into discoveries and innovations that benefit society at large.  It will foster in-depth discussion of technical and application issues for how to engage humans with computers to optimize cost/quality trade-offs.  It will also serve as an introduction to researchers and students curious about this important, emerging field at the intersection of crowdsourced human computation and image/video analysis.  Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
 <li>Crowdsourcing image and video annotations (e.g., labeling methods, quality control)</li>
 <li>Humans in the loop for visual tasks (e.g., recognition, segmentation, tracking, counting, etc)</li>
 <li>Richer modalities of communication between humans and visual information (e.g., language, 3D pose, attributes)</li>
 <li>Semi-automated computer vision algorithms</li>
 <li>Active visual learning</li>
 <li>Studies of crowdsourced image/video analysis in the wild</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>We are requesting submissions in the following two categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Original work not published elsewhere.</strong> In addition to research papers describing theoretical or empirical results, this year we are also encouraging demo submissions, describing new systems, architectures, interaction techniques, etc. Papers should be submitted as 4-page extended abstracts (including references) using the provided author kit. Demos should also include a video (max 6 min, 100 MB). Multiple submissions are not allowed.  Reviewing will be double-blind.</li>
  <li><strong>Previously published work from a recent conference or journal.</strong> Authors should submit an unrevised copy of their published work.  Reviewing will be single-blind.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submissions: Email submissions to <a href="mailto:groupsight@outlook.com">groupsight@outlook.com</a></p>
<p>Author Kit: <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit17.zip">AuthorKit17.zip</a></p>

<h2>At the Workshop</h2>
<p>All accepted authors will prepare a poster and/or demo to present during an interactive session at the workshop. The organizers will also invite a subset of authors to give short talks. We will also present two awards at the workshop, for Best Paper and Best Demo, with cash prizes courtesy of our sponsor, Evolv Technology.</p>

<p>Accepted submissions will be posted and publicly downloadable on the GroupSight website. </p>
