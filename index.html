  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    What would be possible if we could accelerate the analysis of images and videos, especially at scale? This question is inspiring widespread interest across communities as diverse as computer vision, human computer interaction, computer graphics, and multimedia.  Some researchers are designing algorithms to automatically analyze visual content, yet many tasks remain too difficult for state-of-the-art algorithms.  Other researchers are investigating ways to leverage crowdsourced human computation to power the analysis of visual content, however this is a more costly and less scalable alternative.  And, at the intersection, lies an emerging research field for how to actively decide when and how to engage humans to cooperate with computers for visual analysis.

  <p class="lead">
    The aim of this workshop is to promote greater interaction between the diversity of researchers and practitioners who examine how to mix human and computer efforts to convert visual data into discoveries and innovations that benefit society at large.  It will foster in-depth discussion of technical and application issues for how to engage humans with computers to optimize cost/quality trade-offs.  It will also serve as an introduction to researchers and students curious about this important, emerging field at the intersection of crowdsourced human computation and image/video analysis.
